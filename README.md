## 📋 Overview

CortexShield is a next-generation malware detection system that uses machine learning to analyze files and detect potential threats. Unlike traditional antivirus software, it provides:

- **Statistical Analysis**: Extracts features like entropy, imports count, section info
- **ML-Based Detection**: Random Forest classifier trained on malware samples
- **Family Classification**: Identifies malware type (ransomware, trojan, spyware, worm)
- **Impact Analysis**: Shows what the malware would do if executed
- **Interactive Simulation**: Visual Windows-like environment showing infection steps
